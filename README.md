# Harry Potter - Top Trumps
A group project for Code First Girls: Introduction to Python Programming

# Features
Get 5 randomly Harry Potter characters and let the player decide which one that they want to use.
  
Player decide how many rounds they want to play and record the outcome of each round. The player with most number
of rounds won, wins the game.

Allow the opponent (computer) to choose a stat that they would like to compare.

Record the outcome of each round and total scores and store them in a csv file.

If player wins/loses the game, a turtle screen opens. For win, a deathly hallows symbol and for lose, Harry Potter glasses with a scar.
